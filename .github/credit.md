# Credit
I'd like to thank [Liam Skinner](https://github.com/ThatsLiamS), for helping me with discord.js. Most frameworks, conventions and methods that I've followed in this bot
were picked up by him. He's helped me with [kekbot](https://github.com/bagelwastaken/kekbot) and I've learnt so much for him.
